                    <p>
                    Python is a powerful modern computer programming language developed by Guido van Rossum, and it is free software. It bears some similarities to
                    Fortran, one of the earliest programming languages, but it is much more powerful than Fortran.
                    Python allows you to use variables without declaring them (i.e., it determines types implicitly),
                    and it relies on indentation as a control structure. You are not forced to define classes in Python
                    (unlike Java) but you are free to do so when convenient.
                    </p>

                    <p>This document focuses on learning Python for the purpose of doing mathematical calculations.
                        We assume the reader has some knowledge of basic mathematics, but we try not to assume any
                        previous exposure to computer programming, although some such exposure would certainly be
                        helpful. Python is a good choice for mathematical calculations, since we can write code quickly, test
                        it easily, and its syntax is similar to the way mathematical ideas are expressed in the mathematical
                        literature. By learning Python you will also be learning a major tool used by many web developers.

                        If you use Mac OS X or Linux, then Python should already be installed on your computer by
                        default. If not, you can download the latest version by visiting the Python home page, at
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        http://www.python.org
                    </p>
                    <p>where you will also find loads of documentation and other useful information. Windows users can
                        also download Python at this website. Don’t forget this website; it is your first point of reference
                        for all things Python. You will find there, for example, reference [1], the excellent Python Tutorial
                        by Guido van Rossum. You may find it useful to read along in the Tutorial as a supplement to
                        this document.

                    <header>Comments in Python</header>
                        <p>In a Python command, anything after a # symbol is a comment. For example:</p>
                        <code>
                            print " Hello world" #Python is fun to learn
                        </code>
                        <p>Comments are not part of the command, but rather intended as documentation for anyone reading
                            the code.
                        </p>
                        <p>Multiline comments are also possible, and are enclosed by triple double-quote symbols:</p>
                        <code>
                            <div class="code-divs">""" This is an example of a long comment</div>
                            <div class="code-divs">that goes on</div>
                            <div class="code-divs">and on."""</div>

                    <p>Python recognizes several different types of data. These include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Integers</li>
                        <li>Floats</li>
                        <li>Long</li>
                        <li>Strings</li>
                        <li>Boolean</li>
                        <li>Lists</li>
                        <li>And Tuples</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="font-size:1.2em">The type function</p>
                    <p>To see the type of some data, use Python’ s builtin type function
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        <div>>>> type ( -75)</div>
                        <div>&lttype ’int’&gt</div>

                    <p>Another useful data type is complex, used for complex numbers. For example:</p>
                    <code>
                        <div>>>> 2j</div>

                        <div>>>> 2j -1</div>
                        <div>>>> complex(2 ,3)</div>
                        <div>(2+3j)</div>
                        <div>>>> type ( -1+2j)</div>
                        <div>&lttype ’complex’&gt</div>
                    </code>

                <section class="main-section" id="Strings">
                        <header>Strings</header>
                        <p>Other useful data types are strings (short for “character strings”); for example "Hello World!".
                            Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            <div>>>> " This is a string "</div>
                            <div>’This is a string ’</div>
                            <div>>>> ’This is a string , too’</div>
                            <div>’This is a string , too’</div>
                            <div>>>> type("This is a string ")</div>

                        </code>

                        <p>Strings are an example of a sequence type.</p>

                        <header>Lists and tuples</header>
                        <p>
                            Other important sequence types used in Python include lists and tuples. A sequence type is formed
                            by putting together some other types in a sequence. Here is how we form lists and tuples:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            <div>>>> [1 ,3 ,4 ,1 ,6]</div>
                            <div>[1, 3, 4, 1, 6]</div>
                            <div>>>> type( [1 ,3 ,4 ,1 ,6] )</div>
                            <div>&lttype ’list ’&gt</div>
                            <div>>>> (1 ,3 ,2)</div>
                            <div>(1, 3, 2)</div>
                            <div>>>> type( (1 ,3 ,2) )</div>
                            <div>&lttype ’tuple ’&gt</div>
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            Notice that lists are enclosed in square brackets while tuples are enclosed in parentheses. Also note
                            that lists and tuples do not need to be homogeneous; that is, the components can be of different
                            types:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            <div>>>> [1 ,2 ," Hello" ,(1 ,2)]</div>
                            <div>[1, 2, ’Hello ’, (1, 2)]</div>
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            Here we created a list containing four components: two integers, a string, and a tuple. Note that
                            components of lists may be other lists, and so on:
                        </p>
                       <code>
                           <div>
                                >>> [1, 2, [1 ,2] , [1 ,[1 ,2]] , 5]
                           </div>
                           <div>[1, 2, [1, 2], [1, [1, 2]] , 5]</div>
                       </code>
                       <p>
                            By nesting lists within lists in this way, we can build up complicated stuctures.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                            Sequence types such as lists, tuples, and strings are always ordered, as opposed to a set in mathe-
                            matics, which is always unordered. Also, repetition is allowed in a sequence, but not in a set.

                        Python expressions are not commands, but rather form part of a command. An expression is
                        anything which produces a value. Examples of expressions are:
                    </p>
                        <code>
                            <div>2+2, 2**100, f((x-1)/(x+1)).</div>
                        </code>
                        
                     <p>  Note that in order for Python to make sense of the last one, the variable x must have a value
                        assigned and f should be a previously defined function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Expressions are formed from variables, constants, function evaluations, and operators. Parentheses
                        are used to indicate order of operations and grouping, as usual.

                     <p>The common binary operators for arithmetic are:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>+ for addition</li>
                        <li>- for subtraction</li>
                        <li>* for multiplication</li>
                        <li>and / for division.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        As already mentioned, Python uses ** for exponentiation. Integer
                        division is performed so that the result is always another integer (the integer quotient):
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        <div>>>> 25/3</div>
                        <div>8</div>
                        <div>>>> 5/2</div>
                        <div>2</div>
                    </code>
                    <p>This is a wrinkle that you will always have to keep in mind when working with Python. To get a
                        more accurate answer, use the float type:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        <div>>>> 25.0/3</div>
                        <div>8.3333333333333339</div>
                        <div>>>> 5/2.0</div>
                        <div>2.5</div>
                    </code>
                    <p>If just one of the operands is of type float, then the result will be of type float. Here is another
                        example of this pitfall:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        <div>>>> 2**(1/2)</div>
                        <div>1</div>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        where we wanted to compute the square root of 2 as the 1
                        2 power of 2, but the division in the
                        exponent produced a result of 0 because of integer division. A correct way to do this computation
                        is:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        <div>>>> 2**0.5</div>
                        <div>1.4142135623730951</div>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Another useful operator is %, which is read as ”mod”. This gives the remainder of an integer
                        division, as in
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        <div>>>> 5 % 2</div>
                        <div>1</div>
                        <div>>>> 25 % 3</div>
                        <div>1</div>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                            which shows that 5 mod 2 = 1, and 25 mod 3 = 1. This operator is useful in number theory and
                            cryptography.

                        Besides the arithmetic operators we need comparison operators: &lt, &gt, &lt=, &gt=, ==, !=, &lt&gt.
                        In order
                        these are read as: is less than, is greater than, is less than or equal to, is greater than or equal to,
                        is equal to, is not equal to, is not equal to. The result of a comparison is always a boolen value
                        True or False.
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        <div>>>> 2 &lt 3</div>
                        <div>True</div>
                        <div>>>> 3&lt2</div>

                    <p>
                        Note that != and &lt &gt are synonomous; either one means not equal to. Also, the operator == means
                        is equal to.
                    </p>
                    <code>

                        <header>Variables and assignment</header>
                        <p>
                            An assignment statement in Python has the form variable = expression. This has the following
                            effect. First the expression on the right hand side is evaluated, then the result is assigned to the
                            variable. After the assignment, the variable becomes a name for the result. The variable retains
                            the same value until another value is assigned, in which case the previous value is lost. Executing
                            the assignment produces no output; its purpose it to make the association between the variable
                            and its value.        
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            <div>>>> x = 2+2</div>
                            <div>>>> print x</div>
                        </code>

                       <p>
                            In the example above, the assignment statement sets x to 4, producing no output. If we want to
                            see the value of x, we must print it. If we execute another assignment to x, then the previous value
                            is lost.
                       </p>
                       <code>
                           <div>>>> x = 380.5</div>
                           <div>>>> print x</div>

                       </code>

                       <p>
                            Remember: A single = is used for assignment, the double == is used to test for equality.
                            In mathematics the equation x = x + 1 is nonsense; it has no solution. In computer science, the
                            statement x = x + 1 is useful. Its purpose is to add 1 to x, and reassign the result to x. In short,
                            x is incremented by 1.

                            Variable names may be any contiguous sequence of letters, numbers, and the underscore (_) char-
                            acter. The first character must not be a number, and you may not use a reserved word as a variable
                            name. Case is important; for instance Sum is a different name than sum. Other examples of legal
                            variable names are: a, v1, v_1, abc, Bucket, monthly_total, __pi__, TotalAssets.

                            The if–else is used to make choices in Python code. This is a compound statement. The simplest
                            form is
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            <div>if c o n d i t i o n :</div>
                            <div>a c t i o n −1</div>
                            <div>else:</div>
                            <div>a c t i o n −2</div>
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            The indentation is required. Note that the else and its action are optional. The actions action-1
                            and action-2 may consist of many statements; they must all be indented the same amount. The
                            condition is an expression which evaluates to True or False.
                        </p>
                        <p>Of course, if the condition evaluates to True then action-1 is executed, otherwise action-2 is exe-
                            cuted. In either case execution continues with the statement after the if-else. For example, the
                            code
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            <div>x = 1</div>
                            <div>if x > 0:</div>
                            <div>print "Friday is wonderful"</div>
                            <div>else:</div>
                            <div>print "Monday sucks"</div>
                            <div>print "Have a good weekend"</div>
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            Note that the last print statement is not part of the if-else statement (because it isn’t indented),
                            so if we change the first line to say x = 0 then the output would be
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            <div>Monday sucks</div>
                            <div>Have a good weekend</div>

                        <p>
                            More complex decisions may have several alternatives depending on several conditions. For these
                            the elif is used. It means “else if” and one can have any number of elif clauses between the if
                            and the else. The usage of elif is best illustrated by an example:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            <div>if x >= 0 and x &lt 10:</div>
                            <div>digits = 1</div>
                            <div>elif x >= 10 and x &lt 100:</div>
                            <div>digits = 2</div>
                            <div>elif x >= 100 and x &lt 1000:</div>
                            <div>digits = 3</div>
                            <div>elif x >= 1000 and x &lt 10000:</div>
                            <div>digits = 4</div>
                            <div>else:</div>
                            <div>digits = 0 # more than 4</div>
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            In the above, the number of digits in x is computed, so long as the number is 4 or less. If x is
                            negative or greater than 10000, then digits will be set to zero.

                        <p>Python provides two looping commands: for and while. These are compound commands.</p>
                        <p style="font-size:1.2em">for loop</p>
                        <p>The syntax of a for loop is</p>
                        <code>
                            <div>for item in l i s t :</div>
                            <div>a c t i o n</div>
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            As usual, the action consists of one or more statements, all at the same indentation level. These
                            statements are also known as the body of the loop. The item is a variable name, and list is a list.
                            Execution of the for loop works by setting the variable successively to each item in the list, and
                            then executing the body each time. Here is a simple example (the comma at the end of the print
                            makes all printing occur on the same line):
                        </p>
                        <code>

                        <p style="font-size:1.2em">while loop</p>
                        <p>
                            The syntax of the while loop is
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            <div>while condition :</div>
                            <div>action</div>
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            Of course, the action may consist of one or more statements all at the same indentation level. The
                            statements in the action are known as the body of the loop. Execution of the loop works as follows.
                            First the condition is evaluated. If True, the body is executed and the condition evaluated again,
                            and this repeats until the condition evaluates to False. Here is a simple example:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            <div>n = 0</div>
                            <div>while n < 10:</div>
                            <div>print n,</div>
                            <div>n = n + 3</div>
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            This produces the following output
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            <div>0 3 6 9</div>
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            Note that the body of a while loop is never executed if the condition evaluates to False the first
                            time. Also, if the body does not change the subsequent evaluations of the condition, an infinite
                            loop may occur. For example
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            <div>while True:</div>
                            <div>print " Hello "</div>
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            will print Hellos endlessly. To interrupt the execution of an infinite loop, use CTRL-C.
